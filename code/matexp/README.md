The code is obtained from https://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/cpp_src/matrix_exponential/matrix_exponential.html

This is a C++ library which exhibits and compares some algorithms for approximating the matrix exponential function.


r8mat_expm1 (essentially MATLAB's built-in matrix exponential algorithm using scaling-squaring technique) is used in tree building.
